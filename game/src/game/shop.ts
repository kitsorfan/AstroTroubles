 * levels on top of them, four new upgrades and the weapons. Chapter 2 pays far more bolts, so the
 * new stock costs more: a thorough player can buy most of it by the volcano, but not by the desert.
 *
 * In chapter 3 she also sells Atalanta's own upgrades (once Atalanta has joined, on the Harpy Isles)
 * and outfits for both heroes, priced like the Mk II stock: a chapter 3 level on foot pays a few
 * hundred bolts, so a player who finishes the chapter can own most of it, but not all at once.
