/**
 * The story of ASTROTROUBLES!
 *
 * A glowing space seed, GaScu, lands on a colony ship and grows over it. It puts the crew to
 * sleep in cocoons and steers the ship toward a star, because it would rather burn than be carried
 * to the planet the ship is flying to. Junior engineer Jason wakes up early, rescues the Captain's
 * scared little drone LUX, follows the Captain's recorded logs up six decks, saves Aunt Rosa, frees
 * HALCYON (the ship's computer) from GaScu pollen, and learns the truth: GaScu isn't a monster,
 * it's terrified. At the top, Jason can stop the Heart of GaScu, or, with every memory shard, LUX
 * can talk to it in lights.
 *
 * Chapter 2, GAIA NOVA. Forty years ago General Brennus led the first expedition, in the warship
 * Gorgon, to make Gaia Nova ready for the colony ship. The planet fought back, so he decided to
 * destroy the heart of all its plants, the great flower the scientists named Celestia; they mutinied
 * and launched it into space. Celestia IS GaScu (which is why, when it met the colony ship flying to
 * Gaia Nova, it turned the ship away), and chapter 2 calls it by that real name: Brennus reveals it
 * in his broadcast. Brennus captures Dr. Hypatia's science team, and his drones steal Celestia so he
 * can force its pollen into a Thorn Legion of machines and build the Colossus inside the volcano
 * Mount Atlantas. Jason and LUX cross six regions to free the scientists and Celestia. In the
 * tundra Brennus's snare drone carries LUX off, so Jason climbs the Rockies alone; in the jungle he
 * wakes IRIS, a rainbow droid of the Gardeners that Brennus threw away; and in the volcano Brennus
 * sets the reprogrammed LUX on him, until IRIS sings the control chip off and LUX comes home. The
 * 18 pages of Brennus's journal tell how a boy who loved his grandmother's greenhouse became a man
 * who tries to own everything; with all of them, Jason can talk him down instead of beating him.
