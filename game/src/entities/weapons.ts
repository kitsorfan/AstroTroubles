/**
 * Jason's arsenal. The Blaster is his from the start; on Gaia Nova PANDORA sells five more, and he
 * can switch between the ones he owns at any time (the weapon button, or X on a keyboard).
 *
 * Every weapon has its own range, power, speed and ammo, and a special trick:
 * - range: how far its shots fly before they fizzle out (and how far auto-aim looks);
 * - power: damage per hit, as a share of the Blaster's (1 + Blaster Power);
 * - speed: how fast its shots fly and how quickly it fires again;
 * - ammo: its own clip and reload (each weapon keeps its clip when Jason switches). The Flamethrower
 *   has a fuel tank instead: it drains while it burns and fills up again when it rests.
 * Tap BLAST to shoot; hold it for a charged shot (the Flamethrower just keeps burning while held).
 *
 * Plain data only (no three.js), so the shop and the tests can use it.
